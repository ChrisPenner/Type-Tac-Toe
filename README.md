# Type-Tac-Toe

This is the code companion for this [blog post](http://chrispenner.ca/posts/type-tac-toe);

Since this is a demonstration of type-level constraints it's not `runnable` in the traditional sense, but you can load
it up using `stack repl` and tinker with it.

You'll want to look at these modules:

- [TypeTacToe.hs](./src/TypeTacToe.hs)
- [UsingSingletons.hs](./src/UsingSingletons.hs)
